# Overview



# The name "aizome"
We have a saying in Japanese "青は藍より出でて藍より青し", which directly translates to "Blue comes from indigo, but bluer than Indigo",
which means "The student surpasses the master".
"Aizome" (藍染) (Pronounced "ah-ee-zoh-meh.") is a Japanese term that refers to this traditional art of indigo dyeing. 
I named this library "aizome" to create an end-to-end toolbox that can (1) learn from experts, but (2) perform better than the experts (with multiple agents).
